Welcome to the Community Health Repository of the [@rdmorganiser](https://github.com/rdmorganiser) organization. This repository serves as the central hub for storing and managing our community health files. These files provide important information about our community's guidelines, best practices, and expectations.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to maintain a centralized location for all community health-related files, making it easier for contributors to find and reference them. This repository is intended to be a living document that evolves alongside our community.

## File Structure

The repository contains the following folders and files:

- [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md): Guidelines for contributing to our organization's projects.
- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md): Our code of conduct, outlining expected behavior and standards.
- [Issue Templates](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/.github/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE): Templates for creating bug reports and feature requests in our organization's projects. These templates help us better understand your request and ensure that we're addressing the right information.
- [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/.github/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md): A template to use when creating a pull request in our organization's projects.

## How to Use

By default, these community health files are applied to all repositories within our organization unless overridden by a specific repository. When creating or contributing to a repository, please review and abide by the guidelines and expectations outlined in this repository.

## Overriding a Central File in a Single Repository

Sometimes, you may need to override a central file for your specific repository. To do so:

1. Create a new file in the root of your repository with the same name as the central file (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
2. In this new file, include any changes or additions specific to your repository.
3. Add a note at the top of the file indicating that it overrides the central file (e.g., # This file overrides the central contributing guidelines found in [rdmorganiser/.github](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Contribution Guidelines

Before making changes to any of these files, please review our contributing guidelines in the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). This will help ensure that your contributions are properly formatted and aligned with our community's standards.
